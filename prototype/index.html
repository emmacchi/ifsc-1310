    <div id ="Profile"><p><strong>Satoru Gojo</strong> is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen anime and manga. He is a special grade jujutsu sorcerer,
         meaning that he poses a high threat towards curses in the JJK world. Throughout the series he is commonly dubbed as "The Strongest Sorcerer in the World." With his bestfriend(Suguru Geto) saying to him(before Geto goes on a murderous rampage)
         <blockquote>"Are you the strongest because you're Saturo Gojo, or are you Saturo Gojo because you're the strongest?" - Suguru Geto</blockquote>
         He comes from the Gojo clan, and is the pride of the clan. He worked as a student sorcerer, and he later became a teacher at the Tokyo Jujustu High and uses his influence
          to protect and train the younger generation of Jujutsu sorcerers. </p>
        <h3>Appearance</h3>
        <p>Gojo is a very tall and lean man who is depicted in his late twenties. He has snow white hair and vibrant blue eyes. Normally, Gojo will cover his eyes
            with a black blindfold that gives his hair a spiky appearance, otherwise he will cover his eyes with sunglasses and let his hair have a more casual look.</p>
            While working, Satoru wears a dark blue zip-up jacket with a high collar that's also fairly wide. He wears slim-fit matching black pants and black dress boots. 
            <p>Before switching over to a simple blindfold, Satoru used to wear bandages over his eyes. Satoru enjoys wearing expensive clothing and has a number of casual 
            looks he'll pair with wearing his sunglasses. As a Tokyo Jujutsu High student, Satoru wore the normal school uniform with his sunglasses before adopting any sort 
            of makeshift blindfold.</p>

    <h3>Personality</h3>
    <div id = "Personality">
        <p>Satoru is a complex individual. He is normally seen to be nonchalant and playful towards his students, close colleagues, and friends. However, he is unsympathetic 
        and cruel towards sorcerer executives, an example being his blatant disrespect towards Principal Gakuganji, and his enemies.</p>
        <p>Satoru is extremely confident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful sorcerer, believing himself to be invincible. His opinion of others often only go as far 
        as his judgement of their strength, and he is quite apathetic towards anyone he deems weak. Additionally, greatly influenced by his own desire for power, he is very arrogant. 
        He is convinced that he is the strongest in the world, which he technically is, claiming, during his fight with Toji Fushiguro, that <q><em>throughout the Heavens and earth, I alone
         am the honored one.</em></q></p>
        <p>This can be further exemplified when he was tasked with protecting Riko Amanai, one of the few 'weak' people he genuinely grew to show compassion for. However, any empathy of 
            her death was soon negated by his extensive amount of pride and arrogance after perfecting his reverse cursed technique in his following battle against Toji Fushiguro </p>
        <p>Nevertheless, despite his haughtiness and strength, Satoru is more human than he first appears. After defeating Toji, Satoru retrieved Riko's corpse with a sorrowful look, 
            showing that albeit his recent conceited victory temporarily clouding his feelings, he still felt some grief over her death. He sought to kill the Star Religious Group members
             that were laughing over Riko's death, though was stopped by Suguru Geto — who he relied on as a moral compass at that time — before taking any action. Furthermore, Satoru was later
              left visibly horrified and panicked after learning that Suguru, his one and only best friend, had become a murderous curse user. Satoru attempted to reason with his friend, 
              but eventually realized and accepted that he lost the one person he truly saw as an equal. After having to put an end to Suguru before more calamity arose, it was Satoru's trauma 
              over losing his best friend that caused his ultimate downfall in Shibuya. He was also distraught when Yuji seemingly died.</p>

    <h3>Abilities and Powers</h3>
    <div id = "Abilities">
        <section id="Physical Skills">
    <h4> Overall Skill Level </h4>
        <p>Even among the special grade sorcerers, Satoru is known to be the strongest sorcerer in the series, holding both immense amounts of cursed energy and a dangerously powerful technique. 
        No one can seemingly match his skill level in the current storyline, except for the King of Curses, Sukuna.</p>
    <h5>Master of Hand-to-Hand Combat</h5>

        <p>Satoru, in addition to his overwhelming levels of cursed energy, is also an extremely formidable martial artist in close combat, with extraordinary physical prowess to back up his skills. 
        Q&A with Gege Akutami revealed that Satoru is as skilled as the millennia-old Kenjaku in terms of pure hand-to-hand combat without any cursed energy. He was capable of completely overpowering Jogo in hand-to-hand combat, 
        delivering several precise attacks on Jogo's fatal spots, and could even casually fight off and overpower both Jogo and Hanami with sheer close combat, easily countering their attacks and landing powerful hits that swiftly pummeled them into submission.</p>
         <p>In his duel with Sukuna, Satoru proved to be superior in terms of hand-to-hand combat against the immensely powerful King of Curses, who had previously demonstrated impeccable martial arts skills by simultaneously keeping both Yuji and Maki at bay, 
         consistently being able to overwhelm Sukuna in their later exchanges while clashing their domains to deliver lethal wounds that forced his Malevolent Shrine to crumble within 3 minutes.</p>
    <h5>Immense Strength</h5>

        <p>Satoru has extraordinary physical strength to fight against powerful curses without a problem, easily causing severe injuries to Jogo with powerful punches and throwing him a considerable distance with a single kick during their fight. He was also able to easily 
        rip out Jogo's head and later on his arm with sheer physical force and even managed to casually rip out Hanami's roots. He could casually rip apart transfigured humans, tearing them apart limb-by-limb. He easily incapacitated the likes of Uraume with a single punch,
         which injured them to where even the use of Reverse Cursed Technique was unable to truly heal them, leaving the powerful subordinate of Sukuna still suffering a degree of pain from the lasting wound.</p>
        <p>During his fight with Sukuna, a clash between the two of them destroyed entire buildings, and Satoru proved strong enough to deal critical injuries on the King of Curses using martial arts alone, a feat that not even the strength of Yuji and Maki could achieve. 
        With just a single burst of Black Flash, Satoru was able to damage Sukuna to the point where he temporarily knocked him unconscious by punching him in the heart. 2 punches from Satoru proved sufficient to temporarily stun Mahoraga.</p>
    
    <h5>Immense Speed and Reflexes</h5>

        <p>Satoru is an extremely fast fighter, capable of moving faster than the eye could perceive. He managed to easily outpace Jogo, throwing almost imperceptible punches and kicks. Satoru was even able to successfully react to and dodge the attacks of someone of Toji Fushiguro's level. 
        Satoru can also eliminate a thousand transfigured humans in five minutes.</p>
        <p>He was able to move faster than Uraume, a powerful and experienced sorcerer was able to react and would have killed Kenjaku quickly if Sukuna hadn't intervened. During Satoru's duel with Sukuna, he proved to be faster than the King of Curses, able to continuously outpace Sukuna 
        in their hand-to-hand combat exchanges, repeatedly pushing him into the defense with his speed and catching him off-guard at certain occasions. Satoru even kept up with Sukuna, Mahoraga and Chimera Beast Agito simultaneously.</p>
       
    <h5>Great Tactial Intellect</h5> 
    
        <p>Satoru is quite tactical and capable of figuring out his opponent's plan with minimum information. He has also shown to be extremely adaptable to any enemy he has ever faced so far, knowing precisely what to do to counter their techniques and find ways to defeat them. 
            This is best displayed during his bout against Jogo, Hanami, Choso and Mahito where he was shown to be capable of conceiving multiple battle strategies while fighting at blinding speeds, protecting civilians, keeping property damage to a minimum, all while dodging and 
            evading the attacks of the four curses.</p>
        <p>While fighting Sukuna, faced with the Malevolent Shrine's relentless attacks without his cursed technique, Satoru proved able to calmly develop an effective plan to not only survive, but also counter-attack, by out-healing its sure-hit attack with Reverse Cursed Technique and using Simple Domain to give him an opening to recover his cursed technique. 
            He also demonstrated the great genius to change the conditions of his domain to a degree that left Atsuya Kusakabe, an expert on barrier techniques, astonished.</p>

        <dt><strong>Immense Cursed Energy Reserves</strong></dt>
        <dd>Cursed Energy is the flow of negative emotions that allow sorcerers to cast their sorcery</dd>
        <dt><strong>Black Flash</strong></dt>
        <dd>A phenomenon that occurs when the user applies cursed energy within 0.00001 seconds of a physical hit, causing a spatial distortion that causes their cursed energy to flash black and amplify the destructive power of the strike</dd>
        <dt><strong>Limitless</strong></dt>
        <dd>This technique grants its users nigh-absolute control over space through cursed energy manipulation at an atomic level, resulting in multiple subsequent results and techniques within the overall ability.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Infinity</strong></dt>
        <dd>Neutral form of Limitless, that basically acts as the ability to slow down attacks exponentially as they reach Gojo, effectively creating an infinite space between him and the attacker.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Blue</strong></dt>
        <dd>Reinforced version of neutral limitless by amplifying the Limitless and Negative energy, producing a vacuum</dd>
        <dt><strong>Red</strong></dt>
        <dd>Inverse of Blue, and creates an extremely powerful repulsive force, repelling all matter in its vacinity</dd>
        <dt><strong>Purple</strong></dt>
        <dd>Advanced technique that collides Blue and Red, resulting in an imaginary mass that is launched at the target</dd>
        <dt><strong>Domanin Expansion: Unlimited Void</strong></dt>
        <dd>Satoru's Domain Expansion. It creates a metaphysical space that causes the victims to receive all kinds of stimuli and information endlessly, restraining their thought processes and actions. [13] In terms of raw strength, Satoru's domain is equal to Sukuna's own Malevolent Shrine on the inside, only losing due to Malevolent Shrine's open domain that allowed Sukuna to destroy the barrier of Unlimited Void. Satoru's skill with his Domain Expansion is so great that he can precisely control the range and time of it's activation for only 0.2 seconds, limiting its lasting effect on those he traps within it,[14] and is able to freely change the conditions of Unlimited Void's barrier. Those he makes physical contact with are also immune to its effect. </dd>
